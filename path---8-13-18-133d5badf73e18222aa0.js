I heard a lot about this course on Reddit, particularly that it was rather demanding and covered a lot of topics. Additonally, I would say that at least in terms of the Reddit population, this course is ranked second only to Harvard\'s CS50 in terms of being the best open-source education introduction to programming course. </p>\n<p>Also, years before I started programming, very crude videos of the lectures for this course were uploaded to Youtube. This was during the nascent days of open-source education, when audio and video quality left a lot to be desired. Regardless, I was only able to watch a few minutes of the first lecture before losing interest (at that time I was not willing to download anything in order to learn programming), namely because I still had no idea what programming was.</p>\n<p>I took this course after doing a lot of data visualization stuff and a little bit of webscraping with Python. I was getting to the point where I could write simple programs that worked, but nothing beyond that. In other words, there was not much thought about good design or runtime -- I was very much in a "if it works, it works" mentality, primarily because I didn\'t know any better. Things like encapsulation or solving a problem using recursion (especially since I didn\'t know what recursion was at the time) never crossed my mind.</p>\n<p>However, as I began to broaden my knowledge of programming, I learned that the little things matter. It was not enough to solve a problem, but it was important to do so using best-practices. This, combined with the fact I was looking for a course that would be difficult and had a good reputation, led me to enroll in the audit track for 6.00.1x. Oh yea, of course the primary motivation for me enrolling in the course was to finally take that course which perplexed me so much as a younger man.</p>',frontmatter:{path:"/8-13-18",title:"MIT 6.00.1x Course Review"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
